# Assignment2 - Image Processing Project
>>>>>>> 81608a0ade342749c621f64103dc0c188620df00

This project is a simple image processing application written in Java. It allows you to read an image, resize it to fit the computer screen, and perform multi-threaded image processing with visualization, and save the image to a file. Firstly we read the image using the command line, and choose the mode we want to raster the image and see while the process happens. Here S is used for Single Threaded processes, while M is used for Multi Threaded processes.
